\begin{itemize}
  \item
Build deterministic finite automata and/or regular expressions (as
requested) for each of the languages in questions \ref{langfirst} to
\ref{langlast}.  Create simple, meaningful automata and regular
expressions (rather than, {\em e.g.}, using the algorithm to create a
regular expression from a DFA) and explain how they work.  In all
cases the alphabet is $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$.
\item
DFAs should be specified with pictures, preferablly
typeset with {\bf TikZ}, not tables
(as tables are very hard to read).  Try to typeset them so that the
labels on the arcs are clear, {\em etc.}
\item
If you are having a difficult time with {\bf TikZ}, clear, legible
hand-drawn figures (or figures created with a drawing program)
are acceptable as graphics inclusions into your \LaTeX\ 
documents. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \label{langfirst}
  The language $\{100, 10, 011\}$.
  Regular expression: 

\item   The language $\{100, 10, 011\}$.
  DFA:
    

\item The set of 
  all strings that begin or end with a doubled digit, either 11 or 00.
  Regular expression:

  
\item The set of 
  all strings that begin or end with a doubled digit, either 11 or 00.
  DFA:

  
\item
The set of all strings that have exactly one doubled digit in them.
  In other words, either 11 or 00 occurs in the string, but not both,
  and it only occurs once.
  Regular expression:
  

\item \label{langlast}
The set of all strings that have exactly one doubled digit in them.
  In other words, either 11 or 00 occurs in the string, but not both,
  and it only occurs once.
DFA:

\item Use the pumping lemma to show that the language that consists of
  all {\em palindromes} over $\Sigma=\{0,1\}$ is not regular.  A palindrome
  is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards, for example
  11011, 01010, 0, and 0110.
  \[ L = \{w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid w = w^R\}\]

\item Use the pumping lemma to show that the following language is not
  regular.  For examples, 00110000, 0111000 and 00 are in the
  language, but 110 is not.
  \[ L = \{0^i1^j0^{i+j} \mid i,j\in\mathbb{N} \} \]
    


\item Give an example of a regular language $R$ and a nonregular
  language $N$ such that $R\cup N$ is regular.  Describe all three
  languages in English and either prove they are regular/nonregular,
  or show that they are instances of languages with known regularity.
