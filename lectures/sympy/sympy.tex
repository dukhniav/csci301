  You may want to familiarize yourself with symbolic algebra packages,
  such as the {\bf Sympy} package which runs in python.

  \begin{description}
    \item[Example 1.] The following
  session allowed me to simplify two complex expressions
  and prove they were identical.

  I had derived this expression:
  \[
  \frac{k \left(k + 1\right) \left(2 k + 1\right)}{6} + \left(k + 1\right)^{2}
  \]
  And another expression I derived:
  \[
\frac{1 \left(k + 1\right) \left(k + 2\right) \left(2 k + 3\right)}{6}
\]
And I wanted to show that these were equal.

Sympy to the rescue!  
  Sympy even formatted them in \LaTeX\ for me:
  \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
>>> import sympy
>>> k = sympy.symbols('k')
>>> exp1 = k*(k+1)*(2*k+1)/6 + (k+1)**2
>>> print(sympy.latex(exp1))
\frac{k}{6} \left(k + 1\right) \left(2 k + 1\right) + \left(k + 1\right)^{2}
>>> exp2 = (k+1)*((k+1)+1)*(2*(k+1)+1)/6
>>> print(sympy.latex(exp2))
\frac{1}{6} \left(k + 1\right) \left(k + 2\right) \left(2 k + 3\right)
>>> sympy.expand(exp1)
k**3/3 + 3*k**2/2 + 13*k/6 + 1
>>> print(sympy.latex(sympy.expand(exp1)))
\frac{k^{3}}{3} + \frac{3 k^{2}}{2} + \frac{13 k}{6} + 1
>>> sympy.expand(exp2)
k**3/3 + 3*k**2/2 + 13*k/6 + 1
>>> print(sympy.latex(sympy.expand(exp2)))
\frac{k^{3}}{3} + \frac{3 k^{2}}{2} + \frac{13 k}{6} + 1
>>> 
 \end{Verbatim}
  Thus I knew that both expressions were equal to
  \[
  \frac{k^{3}}{3} + \frac{3 k^{2}}{2} + \frac{13 k}{6} + 1
  \]

\item[Example 2.]
  For another example,
consider the example in {\em the Book of Proof}, p.~155. We need
to prove that if \[k^5 - k = 5a\] for some $a\in\mathbb{Z}$, then
\[(k+1)^5 - (k+1) = 5b\] for some $b\in\mathbb{Z}$.

We can prove that
they are both multiples of 5 if we can prove that 
their difference is, so let's look at the difference:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
>> from sympy import *
>>> k = symbols('k')
>>> exp1 = k**5 - k
>>> exp2 = (k+1)**5 - (k+1) 
>>> expand(exp2 - exp1)
5*k**4 + 10*k**3 + 10*k**2 + 5*k
\end{Verbatim}
From which we easily get the proof as in the book.
